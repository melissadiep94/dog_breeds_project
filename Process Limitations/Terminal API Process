Terminal API Process 

Terminal View: Petfinder has a secondary way of extracting data via Terminal View .   The process is as follows: 

-	Create a Petfinder account
-	Create a Petfinder API Key (or Client ID) and a Secret Key
-	Using cURL testing, submit API and Secret Key using the following api call 
-	Once the token is received, submit the follow call to complete your request
-	The call will then return a JSON response in terminal
-	After the JSON response is returned, the response is then sent through Jupyter Notbook 
-	The response from this then saved as a JSON file
-	Then saved as a CSV file. 
 
This process has many limitations. 
-	The API call could not be used and/or transferred into Python/Jupyter Notebook.  Instead the code needed to be added as a variable inorder to be “jsonified”.
-	The API call did not allow for us to set multiple parameters (ie: unable to filter by “dogs” and “state: NJ”).  The call would only recognize the first parameter that was set.
-	The API call pulls all pet data for all pet types (cats, dogs, birds, rabbits, etc.).
-	The API call could only do one page at a time; therefore, multiple csv files needed to be created and only 20 pets were listed per page.

Due to the listed limitations, the team decided not use the data from this method.
