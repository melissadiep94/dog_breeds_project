##Project Description/Outline:

Our goal is to find the # of dogs that are able to be adopted in New Jersey, and combine it with characterics of each breed, so that prospective dog owners can make an informed decision on which dog to adopt.

##Data sources:
1. Pet Finder - https://www.petfinder.com/developers/ 
2. Dog breeds CSV/Table - http://www.dogbreedchart.com/#:~:text=Dog%20Breed%20Chart%20%20%20%20Name%20,%20%201%20%2033%20more%20rows%20 

3. https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data 
4. Age Life Span - https://www.petcarerx.com/article/lifespan-of-a-dog-a-dog-years-chart-by-breed/1223?utm_source=linkshare&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=deeplink&utm_content=msYS1Nvjv4c&id=1944&subid=msYS1Nvjv4c&siteID=msYS1Nvjv4c-w4EN7Lh3WF08OHca3.4Hlg&ranMID=38368&ranEAID=msYS1Nvjv4c&ranSiteID=msYS1Nvjv4c-w4EN7Lh3WF08OHca3.4Hlg 
5. Weight - https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/breed-weight-chart/#:~:text=Breed%20Weight%20Chart%20%20%20% 


##Research Questions to Ask:
1. What are the # of dog adoptions in New Jersey currently listed in PetFinder?
2. What are your preferences (size, age, etc.)?
3. Would you adopt this dog?


##Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Create ERD visualization
2. Import petfinder API and save as csv - filter for NJ, pure breed, 
3. For the dog breeds, age life span, weight - copy /paste into excel and save as csv -- we could also try to import into html
4. Input into pandas dataframe
5. trim the pandas dataframe for the petfinder data
6. import into SQL database
